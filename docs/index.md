# Welcome to the CQL documentation

## The big picture

* define a type system
* define avaiblable variables
* parse a text to a query
* queries will be type-checked (validation)
* if everything worked fine, you can use the resulting query to evaluate boolean expressions
* these queries can be built in a WPF composer box or be written in the given language
	* you will be supported with a auto-completion popup and syntax highlighting
